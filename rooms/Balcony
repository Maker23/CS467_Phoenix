LONG DESC: The Balcony would have been an ideal spot to get a view of the property, but with the storm outside, it makes it difficult to see past the front lawn. From here, there is a door on the west wall, a door on the south wall, and a spiral staircase going up.
SHORT DESC: There doesn't appear to be any clues to examine from the Balcony. Check out one of the connecting rooms to escape the haunted house!
ADITIONAL DESC: Go to the 2nd Floor Hallway, 3rd Floor Hallway, or the Study, there doesn't appear to be anything here.
