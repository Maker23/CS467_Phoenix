LONG DESC: The Study was one of the few rooms off limits to guests as it served as the second floor office for the owner. Though there is no overhead lights, but the moonlight shining through the window illuminates the desk. There is also a musty smell in this room, most likely due to the ash tray sitting on the desk. There are 3 exits in this room. There are two doors on the north wall, the 2nd Floor Hallway is on the left side of the wall and the Balcony is on the right side. There is another door on the west wall which leads to the Library.
SHORT DESC: The window is positioned at the center of the wall and you wonder if it's possible to open as a possible escape. A directory lies on the desk that may be valuable on your journey as well. There are two doors on the north wall, one on the left side of the wall and another on the right side. There is another door on the west wall.
ADDITIONAL DESC: The window and directory both seem to be features to check out in this room.
