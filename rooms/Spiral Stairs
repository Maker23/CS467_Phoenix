LONG DESC: There is just enough light shining through the doorway for you to see an oil lamp hung on the wall.  A hallway leads to the west but it's much too dark to walk that way.
SHORT DESC:  The 3rd floor hallway lead off from this staircase; the Balcony is at the bottom of the stairs. An oil lamp hangs on the wall.
ADDITIONAL DESC: The Oil Lamp must be lit to access the 3rd Floor. Find a lighter somewhere in the house to light the way! If the 3rd floor hall is not accessible, stairs down will lead you back to the Balcony.
