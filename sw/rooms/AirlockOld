LONG DESC: From within the helmet, you hear among the sound of your mechanical breathing apparatus, your stormtrooper commander telling his troops to be ready. Seconds later, metallic banging and then laser cutters open the door to the rebel ship. Stormtroopers exit side by side, blasters shooting. Before long, it is just you, Lord Vader, in the airlock, looking at the cutout doorway which is currently your only exit.
SHORT DESC: You are standing in the empty airlock looking at the cut out doorway.
