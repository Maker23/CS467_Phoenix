LONG DESC: The Laundry Room is massive and was a central place for cleaning in this house. You can faintly smell the soap used to clean the residents' and guests' clothing. Metallic equipment in here is glimmering from the moonlight as the storm seems to really pick up. Everything else looks worn and run down, but the final key has to be somewhere on the 3rd Floor! The exit from here is on the north wall back to the 3rd Floor Hallway.
SHORT DESC: The Laundry Room has dingy walls and equipment that echo the storm outside. Exit back to the 3rd Floor Hallway on the north wall.
ADDITIONAL DESC: Check out the wood plank or clothes pile in the Laundry Room. The only exit from here is on the north wall which leads back to the 3rd Floor Hallway.
FEATURE: ClothesPile
