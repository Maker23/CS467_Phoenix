LONG DESC: The Ballroom was once the center for entertainment in this house back in its day. The spacious common room was perfect for guests to mingle and dance, either with a full band or from the record player that sits in the corner. Often times, guests would enter from the Foyer, and appetizers would be served from the Kitchen next door. The vaulted ceiling carried the music evenly across the room to set up the perfect celebration, yet all that can be heard now is the storm from outside. There are two exits on the east wall. The Kitchen is the north side of the wall, the Foyer can be accessed on the south east side of the wall.
SHORT DESC: The Ballroom is tailor-made to house excellent sound, live or recorded. However, all that can be heard is the wind howling from the outside storm.
ADDITIONAL DESC: Try visiting visiting another connecting room to find a record to play on the record player, Maybe in the Foyer or Kitchen.
