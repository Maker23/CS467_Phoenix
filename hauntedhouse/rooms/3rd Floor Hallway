LONG DESC: The storm rages on and the options of rooms left to find a key to escape this house are dwindling down. The 3rd Floor rarely received a visit by outside guests, so something may have been intentionally left behind for those looking. There is a door on the east wall that leads to the Spiral Stairs, and a door on the north wall that leads to the Master Bedroom. There are two exits on the south wall, the southeast exit leads to the Laundry Room and the southwest exit leads to the Bedroom.
SHORT DESC: The 3rd Floor creaks with every step you take and the rain from the storm outside covers the windows. The exits from here include the Marble Stairs, Bedroom, Laundry Room, Master Bedroom, and Spiral Stairs
ADDITIONAL DESC: Look in one of the rooms to find the Final Key.

BLOCKED_TEXT: It's much too dark.
