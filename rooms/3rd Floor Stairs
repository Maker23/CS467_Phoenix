LONG DESC: There is just enough light coming up the stairs to see an oil lamp hung on the wall.  A hallway leads to the south but it's much too dark to walk that way.
SHORT DESC:  The 3rd and 2nd floor hallways lead off from this staircase. An oil lamp hangs on the wall.
ADDITIONAL DESC: The Oil Lamps on the stairs to the 3rd Floor Hallway must be lit to access the 3rd Floor. Find a lighter somewhere in the house to light the way! If the 3rd floor hall is not accessible, stairs down will lead you back to the 2nd Floor Hallway.
