ROOM NAME: Conservatory
CONNECTION:West door|Foyer|foyer, west, west door, door
LONG DESC: The Conservatory is filled with bookshelves that cover the wall from floor to ceiling, but the dimly lit candle makes it difficult to make out any of the book titles. Spiderwebs are covering the bookshelves so that seems to have been abandoned for quite some time as well. The Conservatory was usually off-limits for guests, so this seems like the perfect place for the owner to stash something secret. There is a door to the west leading back to the Foyer.
SHORT DESC: Though there are books filled in this room, it's too difficult to take out a single one or read any of the texts for clues. This narrow room may actually have a clue in plain sight! There is a door to the west leading back to the Foyer.
ADDITIONAL DESC: Play specific notes on the piano to find a rare clue left by the house owner. There is a door to the west leading back to the Foyer.
FEATURE: Piano1
FEATURE: Key1
