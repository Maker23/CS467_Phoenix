LONG DESC: There is just enough light shining through the doorway for you to see an oil lamp hung on the wall.  A hallway leads to the west but it's much too dark to walk that way.
SHORT DESC: The Spiral Stairs are dim, but the light from the Balcony help you up the first couple steps. the Balcony is at the bottom of the stairs and there is another room up the stairs. An oil lamp hangs on the wall.
ADDITIONAL DESC: The Oil Lamp must be lit to access the 3rd Floor. Find a lighter somewhere in the house to light the way! If the 3rd floor hall is not accessible, stairs down will lead you back to the Balcony.
