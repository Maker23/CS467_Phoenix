To start the Haunted House game in normal mode, type

   ./game 

There are in-game instructions; some of them will print automatically, and
you can see additional instructions by typing "help" or "hint"

The file "cheatsheet.txt" contains all the commands, in order, that a player
could use to finish the game.  You can also have the game play through this
file automatically by typing

   ./game -test cheatsheet.txt

Note that you will have to cut-and-paste the solution to the cryptogram into
the game when it reaches that point; the solution is printed out in the 
instructions as the test runs, and can also be seen in the cheatsheet.txt file.

Two additional, partial games are included to demonstrate the capabilities 
of the game interpreter. There is no need to recompile the binary; simply type

	 ./game -dir sw    (for the Star Wars partial game)
   ./game -dir MM    (for the Modern Mansion partial game)
