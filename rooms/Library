LONG DESC: This Library, unlike the Conservatory downstairs, has minimal dust and spiderwebs covering the bookshelves. It's almost as if these books have been opened up and read recently by someone ... or something. The condition of these shelves seem so out of place from the rest of the house! There are hundreds of books to choose from, but one in particular may hold a clue. There are doors on the north wall and the east wall.
SHORT DESC: The lighting and layout of this room was intended to allow any guest to read from any of the books filling the shelves. There are so many to choose from, but ones with fewer dust residue stand out from the rest. Try reading a book to find out what clue lies in this room!
ADDITIONAL DESC: Read a book to find out what clue was left behind in the Library.
